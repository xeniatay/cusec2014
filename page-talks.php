Abstract: "The Birth & Death of JavaScript"

This talk traces JavaScript's impact on software development tools over
forty years, from 1995 until 2035. Although the language is mostly dead
today, it drove the largest transformation of mainstream development tools
since the creation of Unix 65 years ago.

We'll examine some key moments in JavaScript's history: its accidental rise
to popularity; asm.js, allowing arbitrary software to run at native speed
in browsers; the language ecosystem that grew up around asm.js, displacing
JavaScript itself; the replacement of traditional Unix terminals, shells,
and editors with new, higher-level equivalents running against the DOM; and
finally, the inversion of the browser-OS relationship, still ongoing.

This story is told by someone who was a fervent JavaScript detractor during
its rise. It was easy to see the language's numerous and glaring
shortcomings, but miss the path that it laid out.

"This tutorial will provide a practical introduction to contributing code to Firefox. Learn how to find tasks to work on, teams to join, and tricks for navigating the 10 million lines of C++/JavaScript. We'll also walk through practical worked examples, such as adding a new DOM API for websites to use, and moving I/O onto a background thread."

Abstract: “What is Design Thinking?”
Creating innovative solutions and products that deliver value for users is rooted in the ability to understand user needs and what will enable them to reach their goals. However, we often forget that users are human, a complex mixture of logic and emotions. Successful products and services appeal to both the rational side as well as the emotional side of human intelligence. Design Thinking provides an approach for balancing these needs by combining traditional business and technological understanding with insights into human behaviour.
