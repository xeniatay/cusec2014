                        The top 3 teams as voted by the audience will receive prizes sponsored by <a href="http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca" title="Velocity">Velocity</a>. In addition, the team in 1st place will receive an exclusive invitation to dinner with our speakers and sponsor representatives.

                        In addition to presenting to an audience of fellow CUSEC attendees, you will be presenting to a panel of judges made up of speakers and sponsors whose job it is to offer feedback, advice, and their expertise.
