The app is written in CoffeeScript and uses the express framework for Node.js. It hooks into Twitter\'s streaming api, particularly the POST statuses/filter and uses bootstrap, JQuery, and Google Maps on the front end. Since being published in late October last year, the app has received international press coverage, 3K+ shares on Twitter, 9K+ shares on Facebook, and over 250K unique visitors from around the world. <br/>There is a full write up at http://mgingras.ca/coding/fBomb/.',
        'explanation' => 'My inspiration for this application actually came from a discussion I had with two colleagues of mine while doing co-op at BlackBerry, Ryan Seys and Elliott Ro. We were talking about how people misuse and abuse the english language. As the conversation devolved swearing was brought up. In particular we talked about how swearing can completely undermine ones argument. Earlier that day we had been talking about the personal projects we were working and, somehow at this point we circled back to that topic. From there our conversation wound it\'s way to how it\'d be neat to map where people swear. Within a few minutes and iterations of ideas the concept for the app was born. <br/>Project: <a href="http://www.fbomb.co">http://www.fbomb.co</a> - Code: <a href="http://www.github.com/mgingras/fBomb">http://github.com/mgingras/fBomb</a>'

I’ve been incorporating many diverse ideas into my work, from my own investigative research, to the mathematical and philosophical works of Aristotle and George Boole, and to the modern ideas in artificial intelligence from the last 60 years. <br/> I’m working on this project independently. I\'m writing a series of papers on this topic. The first paper in the series is close to completion, and will be a 30-page broad introduction to the fundamental theory behind this work and to serve as an intuitive basis from which to understand later works in the series.',

Since over one year ago, I haven't been able to stop thinking about this problem of how to build an intelligent machine. Ray Kurzweil, Director of Engineering at Google, believes that we’re very close to building this type of technology, and that's the goal I'm working towards.'

This application is a virtual representation launched when the user scans a designated target with their device. <br/>Through the app, visitors of the gallery are immersed within an augmented reality experience that provides an alternate view and virtual flythrough of the piece. In addition, series of markers located in the exhibition connect to virtual information panels that describe various aspects and details of the work. <br/>This application was showcased alongside Dr. Hosale\'s piece in the following countries: <br/>1) Canada (LandSlide Future Possibilities Exhibit - Ontario)<br/>2) China (Shenzhen Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism/Architecture - Hong Kong)<br/>3) Denmark (renew Digital Arts Forum - Copenhagen)<br/>It is currently available on the Google Play Store, and is in the process of being accepted to the Apple AppStore.',
        'explanation' => 'We were recruited by the artist who required developers to design a mobile application that would accompany his piece in the Markham Museum. Dr. Mark-David Hosale was also interested in taking his piece to several different exhibitions internationally, and wanted a standalone application which would provide users with information on the piece as well as extend the virtual experience. <br/>We met with the artist and brainstormed ideas for an augmented reality concept which was later on developed and exhibited in the museum. Due to the large physical size of the piece, transporting it internationally was not feasible, therefore this application would be useful for those who wanted to see the piece in it\'s entirety. Inspiration was drawn from the idea of virtual spaces, and the idea of experiencing physical objects without being physically present in the space. <br/>Here is a link to the Google Play store where Homunculus Series AR can be downloaded: <a href="http://bit.ly/1d1rzvq">http://bit.ly/1d1rzvq</a> <br/>**It is currently in the process of being accepted to the Apple AppStore.'
